::: danger ☠️ What are you doing here?
Silly reader, I told you I haven’t written or translated any blog posts yet, you silly goose! You should trust me more next time!  
You were going to get 404’d anyway if I hadn’t foreseen your hubris and created this page.  
You can thank me later, for now, why not go back to the [home page](/) instead?

::: tip 💡 Still here?
Even if you understood Portuguese and really wanted to read the blog posts, I haven’t written any yet. But since you’re persistent, here’s the link to the [Portuguese version of the blog](/pt/blog), where they might reside one day, if I ever write any. Just don’t expect to find anything there… yet.
