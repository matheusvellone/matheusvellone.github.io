# matheusvellone.github.io

This is my personal [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site, built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev), serving as my one-stop shop for everything about myself, my work, and my thoughts on software engineering.

  - [English Guides](docs/guides.md) (coming soon!)

- **Blog:** Occasional ramblings, tips, and stories from my experience in tech.
  - [English Blog](docs/blog.md)
  - [Portuguese Blog](docs/pt/blog/index.md)
- **About:** Who I am, what I do, and how to find me online.
  - [English About](docs/about.md)
  - [Portuguese About](docs/pt/about.md)
